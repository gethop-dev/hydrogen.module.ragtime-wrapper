# module.ragtime-wrapper

Duct module that wrapping configuration for Ragtime migrations. We got a feeling that writing them by hand takes way too much space in config.

Of course there are still some loose ends. For one, it could be more explicit about the ordering of migrations.

## Usage

Istead of adding `:migrations [#ig/ref ... #ig/ref ...]` and a bunch of key definitions just add this to your ragtime config:

```edn
:migrations-paths ["myproject/migrations/001-create-initial-schema"
                   "myproject/migrations/002-do-stuff"]
```
